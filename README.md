EyefiServerSynology
===================

Eye-Fi Server working with Synology.

This is a stripped down version of http://code.google.com/p/eyefiserver2/, containing just what you need to fire it up and a few smaller changes.

Start with ./eyefiserver.py start /full/path/to/eyefiserver.conf /full/path/to/a/log/file.log

Also, if you want the chown to work you'll need to run this as root.
